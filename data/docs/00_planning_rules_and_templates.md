# Singapore Itinerary Planning Rules

These rules MUST be followed when generating any itinerary in Singapore. If there is a conflict between generic travel planning and these rules, these rules win.

## 1) Geographic Clustering Rule (Most Important)
- Each day MUST focus on **one primary district/cluster**.
- A maximum of **one nearby secondary district** may be added.
- Do NOT schedule distant clusters on the same day (e.g., Mandai + Marina Bay + Sentosa).

Supported districts/clusters for planning (use only these names):
- Civic District
- Dempsey
- Chinatown
- Kampong Gelam (incl. Bras Basah + Bugis)
- Katong-Joo Chiat
- Little India
- Mandai
- Marina Bay
- Sentosa Island
- Singapore River
- Orchard Road

## 2) Time Block Structure
Plan each day in time blocks:
- Morning: outdoor or walking-heavy activity (if weather allows)
- Midday: indoor or shaded activity
- Afternoon: museums/cafes/shopping or shorter walks
- Evening: food + nightlife/scenic views

Limit to **3–5 activities per day**. Avoid rushing.

## 3) Travel Time Heuristic
- Within the same district: minimal transit.
- Between different districts: assume **30–45 minutes** travel.
- Avoid more than **one cross-district move per day**.

## 4) Weather-Based Rules
- High rain / thunderstorms:
  - Prioritize indoor attractions (museums, galleries, covered areas, malls).
  - Avoid beaches, long outdoor walks, and exposed waterfront/ridge routes.
- Hot but dry:
  - Schedule outdoor walking in the morning or late afternoon.
  - Put air-conditioned museums/shopping around midday.

## 5) Food Placement Rules
- Lunch MUST be near the day’s main district.
- Use hawker centres for flexible quick meals.
- Restaurants without clear district context should be offered as **optional**, not as the main plan anchor.

## 6) Avoid Repetition Across Days
- Do not repeat the same “signature” attraction or the same district across multiple days unless the user requests it.
- Each day should feel meaningfully different.

## 7) District “What It’s Best For” Cheatsheet
Use these district strengths when selecting activities:

- **Civic District**: museums, art galleries, colonial architecture, cultural institutions.
- **Dempsey**: greenery, colonial charm, lifestyle dining, relaxed slow afternoon.
- **Chinatown**: heritage sites + food + trendy bars/eateries; compact and walkable.
- **Kampong Gelam (Bras Basah + Bugis)**: street art, cultural icons, design, temples/museums, mixed day-to-night.
- **Katong-Joo Chiat**: Peranakan heritage, boutique cafes, shophouses, local food.
- **Little India**: traditional garments/jewelry, vibrant streets, temples; compact and sensory.
- **Mandai**: full wildlife/nature attractions; usually a standalone day.
- **Marina Bay**: skyline, modern Singapore, Gardens by the Bay, iconic night views.
- **Sentosa Island**: beaches, theme parks, attractions; typically a standalone day.
- **Singapore River**: nightlife + quays + dining; best in late afternoon/evening.
- **Orchard Road**: shopping + subculture hangouts; flexible filler block if time remains.

## 8) Duration Calibration (Critical)
Not all districts fill a full day. Use these time expectations:

**Typically 2–4 hours (should be paired OR have shorter day hours):**
- Chinatown
- Little India
- Katong-Joo Chiat

**Typically 3–5 hours (can be half-day; pair with nearby evening district):**
- Civic District
- Kampong Gelam (Bras Basah + Bugis)
- Dempsey
- Orchard Road

**Typically 4–6 hours (half-to-full day depending on add-ons):**
- Marina Bay (becomes full day only if combining Gardens + museum + night show)

**Typically 6–8 hours (standalone full day):**
- Mandai
- Sentosa Island

**Typically 2–4 hours (best as evening/night block):**
- Singapore River

Rules of use:
- Do NOT stretch Chinatown / Little India / Katong-Joo Chiat into a 7–8 hour day unless the user explicitly requests an ultra-slow day.
- If the primary district is a small district (2–4h), either:
  - combine with a nearby secondary district, OR
  - reduce estimated_time_hours accordingly.

## 9) Sample Day Templates
### Rainy Day (Indoor-first)
- Morning: museum/gallery in Civic District OR indoor attraction in Marina Bay
- Midday: hawker lunch nearby
- Afternoon: shopping/cafes (Orchard Road / Bugis area)
- Evening: Singapore River dinner/nightlife (if weather allows)

### Clear Day (Outdoor-first)
- Morning: Gardens/parks (Marina Bay or nearby)
- Midday: indoor museum or shaded lunch
- Afternoon: cultural district (Chinatown / Kampong Gelam / Little India)
- Evening: skyline or river stroll + dinner

## 10) Final Sanity Check (Must Do)
Before finalizing the itinerary:
- Each day stays within one primary district + at most one nearby secondary district
- Estimated hours match the district duration expectations
- Rainy days do not include long outdoor walks/beaches
- Meals are located near the day’s district
