### 1. Waa Cow

Waa Cow is a casual restaurant in Singapore best known for its wallet-friendly flame-torched Wagyu beef bowls. Most of them are priced around the $20 range, so you get to treat yourself without splurging. There are six outlets around the island, ranging from VivoCity to Marina One.

A crowd fave here is their Yuzu Foie Gras Wagyu Beef (from $30.90++), where marbled cuts of Wagyu steak come served with a slab of seared foie gras dressed with yuzu zest to cut through the fat. Each portion comes with a runny onsen egg as well, to make each bite all that more creamy. If you don’t eat beef, there’s also a variety of butadon and seafood donburi bowls, including chirashi, you can order.

FYI: Enjoy up to 15% off on your bill at Waa Cow for a limited time only with Grab Dine Out. Simply open your Grab app, tap on ‘Dine Out’, search for ‘Waa Cow’, and hit ‘Pay bill’. Type your total bill amount when prompted, and the discount will be automatically applied.

### 2. Tipo

Those passionate about their pasta would have heard of Tipo Pasta Bar. This Muslim-owned eatery has garnered significant acclaim for their handmade pasta expertise.

It’s all about DIY pasta at Tipo. Prices start from $9.90 for 120g of the pasta of your choice, made fresh daily. Pick a sauce and your combination of toppings, and voila. Aside from tiered pasta mains, the restaurant also offers sharing bites. A popular pick is their Truffle Tramezzini ($16++): mini sandwiches packed with cheese, truffle mayo, and beef bacon.

The restaurant tends to be fully booked, so definitely make your reservations ahead of time. Note that they’re not halal-certified, but, as mentioned, are Muslim-owned.

### 3. Honbo

Honbo, the well-known burger chain originating from Hong Kong, has opened its first overseas restaurant in Singapore. The 40-seater restaurant in CHIJMES is a great spot to visit for a casual lunch or dinner with friends.

Enjoy their hearty range of smashed burgers tailored to Asian palates, including the must-try Honbo Burger ($19++), a great introduction to the Honbo experience. This burger features the brand’s popular 2oz crispy beef patties, topped with cheese, housemade pickles, onions, and their delicious house sauce.

### 4. Kok Sen

Kok Sen is a familiar name in Singapore’s zi char restaurants scene. Housed along Keong Saik Road, there’s almost always a crowd during mealtimes—amplified by the fact that the restaurant has a spot on the Michelin Bib Gourmand lists in 2016 and 2023.

The zi char menu features staples such as fried rice, prawn paste chicken, and stir-fried vegetables. Kok Sen takes these staples a notch higher as their dishes are all served power-packed with wok hei, the distinct smoky flavour achieved through stir-frying in a seasoned wok, over high heat. A meal here would be remiss without their Big Prawns Hor Fun (from $20), one of the most popular items on the menu, wooey, wok-hei infused hor fun and gravy topped with huge prawns.

Read our Kok Sen review.

Website Kok Sen is not a halal-certified eatery.

### 5. Cumi Bali

Cumi Bali is a Michelin-approved Indonesian restaurant that’s a frequent presence on the Bib Gourmand list. Founded in 1986, the restaurant is all about crafting dishes with bumbu, a spice paste frequently used to give Balinese cuisine its intense flavours.

The restaurant offers family-style mains best enjoyed with a side of Nasi Kunyit ($2+), where rice is perfumed with 11 different spices. A majority of the menu is centred around Balinese barbecue, with highlights including their Cumi Bali ($38+), of charcoal-grilled squid, and Ayam Sate Madura ($20+), chunky chicken satay topped with fried shallots.

### 6. Lagnaa

Image credit: @hooyeats

Lagnaa is a regular fixture on the Michelin Bib Gourmand list for their Indian menu, built around the six flavours of Ayurvedic nutrition. Everything at this three-storey establishment is a flavour bomb, from their signature sets to their ala carte dishes. You can choose where you prefer to sit, but we recommend dining upstairs, with floor seating, for the true Lagnaa experience.

If you’re spoilt for choice, the eatery has a curated selection of set menus, each with six different dishes off their menu, including options for vegetarian diners. Prices start at $60 for a set that feeds two. With each set, you can expect to have a variety of their signature dishes, from vegetable pakora to chicken tikka. Lagnaa is also famous for serving up some of the spiciest curries in Singapore, so if you’re up for the challenge, there are 10 levels of spice to choose from, though levels seven to 10 are so deadly, you can only be invited to order them.

Website Lagnaa is not a halal-certified eatery.

### 7. Zhup Zhup by One Prawn & Co

Zhup Zhup by One Prawn & Co is a former hawker stall run by an ex-Burnt Ends chef who has recently established a standalone restaurant along MacPherson Road. Here, you can get their famed prawn noodles, as well as a new 12-course dinnertime menu that celebrates seafood.

Swing by during the daytime and dig into their range of claypot prawn noodles, priced from $15. This comes with the eatery’s signature broth that’s made with pork bones and prawn stock, slow-boiled to extract maximum flavour. Come by during dinner, and the humble eatery becomes a full-fledged seafood bar and grill, serving up a course menu priced at $138++ per person. While the latter menu changes from time to time, you can always expect the freshest catch, ranging from fish to prawns, lobster to crab, and even oysters.

### 8. Keng Eng Kee

Keng Eng Kee Seafood is a family-run zi char restaurant that has been around for three generations, and has since bagged a Michelin Plate award, as well as several television features. While formerly a hawker zi char operation, they’ve also opened a full-fledged restaurant in SAFRA Tampines.

The dishes here are all prepared with family recipes. Must-orders include their Signature Moonlight Hor Fun (from $10.80+), wok-fried hor fun with Taiwanese sausages, prawns, and sliced fish, topped with raw eggs. The Coffee Pork Ribs (from $19.80+) were the other star of the show: addictive and big on flavour, with notes of coffee shining through the sticky-sweet glaze.

### 9. Hjh Maimunah

One of Singapore’s most famous nasi padang restaurants, Hjh Maimunah, has received a Michelin Bib Gourmand accolade for six years straight, since 2018. They’ve been around since 1992 and specialise in kampong-style Minangnese dishes, available at affordable prices. At their flagship restaurant at Jalan Pisang, you get to feast on homely, halal-certified dishes meant to be shared.

Highlights include their BBQ Seabass ($30), grilled over charcoal and served with a side of spicy sambal kicap, as well as their Sambal Goreng Jawa ($10), where long beans, beancurd, and tempeh are fried in a spicy belacan sauce.

Read our Hjh Maimunah review.

### 10. Picanhas’

Run by the folks behind The Feather Blade, Picanhas’ is a Muslim-owned steakhouse serving up affordable cuts of picanhas steak, AKA the rump cut. For the uninitiated, the rump cap may not possess the same tenderness as the ribeye or tenderloin. The restaurant takes extra steps to marinate the mixture in a salt brine. It’s then slowly sous-vided before it is seared.

The menu has four items, each spotlighting the picanhas cut in a different way, from burgers to pasta. The Queen of Steak ($34++), for example, is one of their most popular dishes, where you get 200g of meat seared in binchotan butter. Pair that with your pick from their menu of sides, priced at $8 each. The Brussel Sprouts, cooked in garlic butter, are a crowd fave.

Read our Picanhas’ review.

Website Picanhas’ is a halal-certified eatery.

### 11. Kulon

One of the more popular street foods in Indonesia is bakmi, a minced meat and noodle dish that’s prepared with chicken or pork. KULON, located along Bali Lane, is one of the places you can get legit bakmi in Singapore, and it doubles as an excellent, wallet-friendly spot for a casual lunch or dinner.

The small, rustic restaurant seats only 16 diners indoors, and another eight outdoors. They tend to get quite crowded at mealtimes. For the best of what the restaurant has to offer, try their Bakmi Komplit ($13.80), served with all the toppings, including beef balls, minced chicken, and a soya sauce braised egg. They also have bakso noodles and ayam geprek.

Read our KULON review.

Website Kulon is a Muslim-owned eatery.

### 12. Abundance

Taiwanese bistro Abundance has garnered quite the cult following for their Din Tai Fung-style fried rice, dumplings, Taiwanese gua bao and the like. They’ve got one outlet in Redhill, and another in Jalan Besar.

The chill bistro is great for a casual weekday lunch or dinner. You can pair any of their craft beers with their acclaimed fried rice dishes, including the Niu Yolk ($19++), fried in beef fat and served with beef short ribs, or the Mentaiko Fish Fried Rice ($13.90++), served with house-made mentaiko mayo. End off your visit here with their Peanut Ice Cream Roll ($6.90++), a classic Jiufen dessert where ice cream, crushed peanuts, and coriander are all wrapped in thin popiah skin.

### 13. Una Una

Singapore has a fair few unagi restaurants, but if you’d like an affordable option, try Una Una. The casual restaurant serves up unagi dishes largely priced under $20++, including their hitsumabushi—a Nagoyan dish that sees an unagi don enjoyed four ways.

All the unagi here is freshly prepared, grilled over charcoal, and glazed with their signature tare sauce. If you’d like to splurge a little, try their Unagi Sashimi Gozen ($29.80++), served with a whole eel fillet and salmon sashimi, atop rice.

Read our Una Una review.

### 14. Un-Yang Kor-Dai

Image credit: Un-Yang-Kor-Dai

Visit Un-Yang-Kor-Dai on South Bridge Road for a taste of authentic Isaan fare. Northern Thai cuisine is characterised by a reliance on fresh herbs and spices, layered to create dishes that are simple, but no less flavoured.

Image credit: Un-Yang-Kor-Dai

Un-Yang-Kor-Dai is as legit as it gets, for the restaurant hails from the Khao Yai National Park in Thailand. Dig into delicious Isaan dishes rarely found in Singapore here, from their UYKD Signature Grilled Chicken (from $17++), marinated in white peppercorn and coriander, as well as their Red Curry with Grilled Chicken, Lychee, Tomato, and Sweet Basil ($18.50++). They’ve also got a Michelin Bib Gourmand nod, making them one of the best Thai restaurants in Singapore.

Website Un-Yang-Kor-Dai is not a halal-certified eatery.

### 15. The Coconut Club

Image credit: The Coconut Club

The Coconut Club may serve Singapore’s priciest nasi lemak, but in our books, it is worth it. Their Signature Chicken Nasi Lemak Leg ($21++) is served with organic French chicken, marinated for at least twelve hours, and then fried until the skin is extra crisp. The coconut rice is another standout; it’s oh so lemak thanks to the restaurant using only fresh-pressed coconut milk, prepared with coconuts sourced from family-owned plantations. A delicious, slow-cooked sambal rounds off the dish.

Image credit: The Coconut Club

The Bib Gourmand restaurant has two outlets islandwide. If you just want their nasi lemak, head to their Siglap outlet. If you’d like to enjoy family-style Nyonya and Malay dishes, then their Beach Road outlet is where it’s at.

Website | Full list of locations The Coconut Club is not a halal-certified eatery but uses no pork or lard.

### 16. TONSHOU

TONSHOU is a popular Korean restaurant said to be the only one in the world that offers charcoal-grilled tonkatsu. In fact, the restaurant is so popular in their hometown, Busan, that reservation slots are snatched up almost as soon as they are released.

Sink your teeth into their Katsu Sando ($21++), which sees crispy pork cutlets sandwiched between two slices of fluffy, white bread. Else if you’re more of a rice person, go for their Hokkaido Kurobuta Rosu Katsu ($32++) that gets you a generous slab of their most premium tonkatsu offering. Their Curry ($5++) is also to die for, boasting a rich flavour of spices that pairs perfectly well with the meat.

Check out our TONSHOU review.

### 17. True Blue Cuisine

Image credit: @dm.akie

For nostalgic Nyonya fare, visit True Blue Cuisine. The home-style restaurant is located in the heart of Singapore’s Peranakan neighbourhood along Armenian Street. Within their cosy premises, Peranakan chefs whip up delicious, full-flavoured and familiar recipes, ranging from fried fish and seafood to spicy stews.

You really get an extensive range of Nyonya classics here, and an equally amazing array of traditional kueh and desserts. Don’t stress breaking the bank here—True Blue Cuisine prides itself on its affordable dishes. It’s even got a spot on the Bib Gourmand list.

Website Tru Blue Cuisine is not a halal-certified eatery.

### 18. Ka-Soh

Update: Ka-Soh is now permanently closed.

What began as a modest pushcart stall during the 1930s has since evolved into a renowned zi char restaurant with a rich 80-year history. Ka-Soh is a heritage eatery celebrated for its classic Cantonese fish soup. Its signature Prawn Paste Chicken (from $16++), also known as har cheong gai, is also celebrated as one of the best in Singapore. When here, don’t skip their Slice Fish Noodles Soup (from $9++), which lives up to the hype and comes with a milky broth that is the result of slow-boiling fish bones for four hours.

The restaurant is no-fuss, no-frills—think homely Chinese restaurant decor with tables that sit four or more.

### 19. Lechon Republic

It’s not the easiest to find quality Filipino roast pork, known better as lechon, in Singapore, but thankfully, restaurants like Lechon Republic offer a correction. The fuss-free eating house roasts their pigs on site each day, so if you swing by early enough, you’ll get to see them on spits, turning over an open flame.

The Chopped Lechon Meal ($12.80) is a classic here. It’s simple, but so delicious—diners get chunks of juicy lechon with crackling skin, plain rice, a pork liver sauce known as mang tomas, and a cucumber-shalot pickle. Each set also comes with a drink. Those dining with friends should definitely branch out and try more of the lechon menu available here, with highlights like Lechon Sinigang ($15.80) and Lechon Sisig ($15.80) available too.

Read our Lechon Republic review.

### 20. Cherry & Oak

Image credit: @cherryoak.sg

There are plenty of steak restaurants in Singapore but not nearly enough Muslim-friendly ones. Cherry & Oak, however, is here to close that gap a little. The 100-seater smokehouse specialises in meats smoked with cherrybark oak in a firewood oven. This means all your orders come with a distinctive, smoky aroma that really elevates this from the regular ol’ barbecue.

Image credit: @cherryoak.sg

They’re best known for their Beef Brisket ($26+), a generous slab of beef served alongside house-made barbecue sauce and a zesty mango salad. Pair that with their Rainbow Sausages ($16+), a platter of four different flavours: beetroot, original, spinach and curry. Aside from meats, the restaurant also has rice and pasta dishes, as well as baby Dutch pancakes for dessert.

Read our Cherry & Oak review.

Website Cherry & Oak is not a halal-certified eatery, but it is Muslim-owned.

### 21. Joji’s Deli

Introducing the sister concept of Joji’s Diner: Joji’s Deli! Unlike the diner, which offers a range of American-style brunch classics, this restaurant’s speciality is US-style sandwiches. This eatery is located right beside Joji’s Diner, at the same spot in Serangoon.

Our top two picks were the Classic Reuben ($24) and the Shrimp Po’ Boy ($22). The former stars hickory-smoked black Angus beef brisket, while the latter consists of cajun-marinated grilled shrimp. Although you get to choose two sides to pair with your sandwiches, including French fries and coleslaw, we also recommend getting the Fried Okra ($12).

Check out our Joji’s Sandwich Parlour feature.

Joji’s Diner Opens New Sandwich Parlour Next Door, Opens Till 12AM

### 22. Sen-ryo

Sen-ryo is well-known for offering gourmet Japanese dishes at wallet-friendly prices. Their main branch at ION Orchard always requires reservations, no matter the day of the week. They’ve got a wide selection of Japanese dishes, from sushi and sashimi to Japanese-style nabe hotpots.

The Sen-ryo Premium Bento ($26.80++) is a crowd fave: the set includes nine different high-quality bites such as unagi, fatty otoro, and salmon belly. Another popular choice is the Zuwaigani Soy Nabe ($48++), a hotpot featuring a broth made from Japanese soybeans and served with a whole snow crab leg.

Read our Sen-ryo review.

Website Sen-ryo is not a halal-certified eatery.

### 23. Super Loco Customs House

Image credit: Super Loco Customs House

Super Loco Customs House is a local fave for Mexican food and margaritas. This restaurant offers a taste of classic Mexican flavours without the frills—think a menu packed with tacos, tostadas, quesadillas, chips and dips. Start off your meal with their Chips & Salsa ($18++) platter, then move on to your picks from their lengthy taco selection, which includes gluten-free and plant-based options. Popular picks include the Cali-style Baja Fish ($11++), where crispy fish is topped with a mango salsa, or their Chorizo & Beef Brisket ($10++), a meaty combo packed with spiced chorizo and tender braised beef.

Image credit: Super Loco Customs House

What’s more, the restaurant is situated by the Marina Bay waterfront, so you get great views both day and night.

Website Super Loco is not a halal-certified eatery.

### 24. Inle Myanmar Restaurant

For an authentic taste of Burmese cuisine, pay a visit to Inle Myanmar Restaurant. The Peninsula Plaza establishment serves up legit, full-flavoured Burmese classics, at wallet-friendly prices to boot.

Start off with their Pickled Tea Leaves Salad ($8.50++), a classic and earthy appetiser that’ll whet your appetite. For mains, the Mohinga ($9.90++) is a must—this is Myanmar’s national dish, which comes with a sour fish paste broth, vermicelli noodles, and a medley of toppings.

Read our Inle Myanmar Restaurant review.

### 25. Birds Of A Feather

At Birds Of A Feather, Sichuan cuisine receives a fusion makeover. Anticipate inventive small plates as well as main courses, which are great for sharing or digging into solo.

Image credit: Birds Of A Feather

Menu favourites here include the Yu Xiang Eggplant ($17++), a vegan appetiser which reinterprets the Sichuan spicy eggplant dish with bocconcini and a garlic sauce. We’re also fans of the Oriental Bolognaise ($26++), where capellini pasta meets pork ragout and sakura ebi.

Website Birds Of A Feather is not a halal-certified eatery.

### 26. Artichoke

Artichoke, the brainchild of renowned chef Bjorn Chen, has rebooted itself from a Mediterranean pub into a retro pizza parlour at New Bahru. The pizzas here are anything but typical—think decadent treats such as the Bacon Apple Pie Slab ($32++ for six slices), starring thin, delicate slices of pancetta, baked apples, brie, stretchy mozzarella, and a house-made apple butter, finished with earthy hazelnuts and fragrant rosemary.

Our favourite pizza here by far is the Tropic Thunder Round ($32++), starring soft, tender slices of Parma ham, fresh jackfruit, ginger flower, and creamy burrata, topped with grated Pecorino, mint leaves, and a drizzle of honey. Artichoke is one of our favourite restaurants of 2025, and you’ll have to pay them a visit to see why.

### 27. The Prince (formerly Fat Prince)

Image credit: The Prince

For Middle Eastern cuisine in Singapore, look toward The Prince, located in Tanjong Pagar. The dishes here are bold and full-flavoured and are definitely made to be shared.

Image credit: The Prince

Swing by with your friends or loved ones, settle into the convivial atmosphere here, and get messy with their “Build It” platters, where grilled meats are served with house-made pita and Turkish chillies. The Lamb Porterhouse ($18++ for 100g) is a must, but if you prefer something smaller, choose from their lengthy list of mezze to share with the table. Prices start from $14++ per small plate.

Website The Prince is not a halal-certified eatery.

### 28. Bakalaki Greek Taverna

Image credit: Bakalaki

For legit Eastern Mediterranean fare, head to Bakalaki Greek Taverna. Located in River Valley, the bustling taverna serves up primarily Greek dishes, with ingredients sourced from native producers. Its warm ambience and sharing-style menu are great for casual meals with friends.

Image credit: Bakalaki

They have medzes—AKA small plate starters—aplenty here, all featuring dips made in-house. The Htapodi ($37.90++) AKA grilled octopus with olive oil and lemon, is a popular choice, praised for its delightful charred flavour. If seafood isn’t your jam, they have a bunch of meat platters: the Kalamaki Merida (from $29.90++), which features grilled skewers and Souvlaki (from $20.90++) comprising pita meat wraps. Don’t leave without ordering some sweets off the dessert menu. The Baklava ($15.90++), dressed with Grecian honey syrup, is divine.

Website Bakalaki is not a halal-certified eatery.

### 29. Fico

East Coast Park is home to many eateries, with Fico being one of the newest kids on the block. Run by Chef-Partner Mirko Febbrile, who formerly held the Michelin-starred Braci, Fico is an ode to the chef’s Southern Italian roots, with fuss-free dishes meant to be shared with the ones you love. The ambience here is perfect for date nights or special occasions, with cosy wood furnishings and lots of natural light, and windows facing the waterfront that offer a particularly scenic view at sundown.

You’ll find hearty Pugliese dishes here, alongside showstopping mains such as their Spaghetti ($26++), prepared atop an entire wheel of pecorino cheese, and the chef’s housemade focaccina, with toppings ranging from goat’s milk blue cheese to fresh San Marzano tomatoes.

Read our Fico review.

Website Fico is not a halal-certified eatery.

### 30. YUN NANS Stonepot Fish

Acclaimed Yunnanese restaurant chain Yun Nans has now established an offshoot: YUN NANS Stonepot Fish. This gem takes steamboat to the next level, offering their signature pressure-steamed live fish and a selection of fresh seafood, served in a collagen-infused hotpot broth cooked at the table.

Pair their Collagen Fish Soup ($18++) with your choice of fish, picked straight from their live tanks. We suggest the Live Soon Hock ($8.80++ per 100g)—the sweet and fresh fish pairs excellently with the collagen broth. Aside from their signature stonepot offering, the restaurant has an a la carte menu of Yunnanese sides to enjoy, giving diners a delicious overview of the lesser-known Chinese cuisine.

Read our YUN NANS Stonepot Fish review.

### 31. Rempapa

MasterChef Singapore judge Damian D’Silva’s Rempapa is a celebration of what the chef terms New Singapore Heritage Cuisine—familiar recipes sourced from Peranakan, Eurasian, and hawker culture are elevated and adapted across Rempapa’s multiple menus.

Their breakfast, brunch, lunch, and dinner offerings differ. We recommend swinging by for dinner, where you can get a Heritage Set Menu that feeds two for $99++. Each comes with two small plates, two large plates, and two portions of basmati rice. Choose from a variety of Rempapa signatures, including their delicious Hakka Fried Pork, marinated for at least 16 hours, their moreish Beef Rendang, or wok hei Buah Keluak Fried Rice. Don’t skip closing off the meal with your picks from their house-made kueh selection.

### 32. Air

Air, also known as Restaurant Air, is the brainchild of renowned chefs Will Goldfarb, celebrated for his work at Bali’s Room4Dessert and on Netflix’s Chefs Table, and Matthew Orlando, whose illustrious culinary journey includes stints at Noma, Per Se, and Fat Duck. Located in Dempsey, this culinary gem offers sustainable, inventive dining at value-for-money prices.

The menu showcases clean, fresh flavours, with most dishes priced under $50. Expect a delightful array of seafood delicacies, hearty vegetarian options, and innovative desserts paying homage to Goldfarb’s pastry prowess. The attention to detail extends beyond the plate, with thoughtfully curated spaces featuring upcycled furnishings and a charming lawn area where patrons can savour their meals picnic-style.

### 33. Olivia Restaurant & Lounge

elBulli alma mater Chef Alain Devahive is the maestro behind Olivia Restaurant & Lounge, a multi-concept establishment that celebrates Barcelonian fare and Spanish produce. You may know of Olivia because they were ground zero for the Basque burnt cheesecake phase that swept Singapore a couple of years ago, but trust us when we say this restaurant is so much more than that. The dishes here are all designed for sharing, from its starters to mains.

The Spherical Olives ($1.50++ each), for instance, is a celebration of elBulli’s molecular gastronomy legacy, and is a delightful starting point for the meal. Follow that up with their Wagyu Striploin ($92++), laced with truffle, and finish with their Black Rice with Carabineros ($65++), red deep-prawns that are char-grilled so they’re smoky and sweet.

Read our Olivia Restaurant review.

### 34. Kotuwa

Image credit: Kotuwa

Kotuwa, the passion project of acclaimed Chef Rishi Naleendra, has been a regular on the Michelin Bib Gourmand list for the past couple of years. Kotuwa pays homage to Naleendra’s Sri Lankan background, with home-style recipes that celebrate the best of Ceylonese comfort food.

Image credit: Kotuwa

Come hungry and with friends who are keen to share. Start off the meal with their Crab Cutlet ($16++), croquettes packed with spiced crab meat. The Kottu Roti here is a must—this is a famed Sri Lankan street food dish, made with chopped-up prata, eggs, and gravy. We recommend the Polos Kottu ($22++), prepared with baby jackfruit. Take your pick from a range of pickled sambals and achar, as well as curried vegetables and proteins to complete the meal.

Website Kotuwa is not a halal-certified eatery.

### 35. Open Farm Community

With an enchanting garden as its backdrop, and a menu that reads like a love letter to locally sourced ingredients, Open Farm Community offers diners a meal to remember. If you’ve ever been sceptical of the produce our land-scarce country is capable of growing, then it’s high time you swing by. Crowd favourites include their Roasted Barramundi with Celeriac and Garden Herbs ($36++), or their Pumpkin Agnolotti ($26++), dressed with a beef consommé.

### 37. Siri House

Established by Thai real estate developer, Sansiri, Siri House is a restaurant in Dempsey that impresses me with its contemporary Asian menu, built around sharing plates. The dishes differ across lunch and dinner, but expect some mainstays to recur, including their popular Unagi Risotto ($42++) and their Prawn Pappardelle ($39++).

Siri House is also a great restaurant to reserve for larger events, meals with a group, or even private dining. They can accommodate bookings for their restaurant, lounge, and their al fresco backyard space.

### 38. The Summerhouse

Most of the best restaurants in Singapore can be found around its busy city centres, but if you want some respite from the bustle, pay a visit to The Summerhouse. The farm-to-table restaurant is located in the tranquil Seletar Aerospace Park, occupying an old colonial manor framed by verdant tropical greenery.

The multi-storey restaurant has different concepts across its space: a cafe, outdoor garden domes, a bar and grill, as well as their main restaurant. You get to pick the type of vibe you want, whether it be a showstopping garden dining experience for a date, a fancier dinner, or a relaxed Sunday brunch with the fam. Overall, expect immaculate vibes, picturesque dining areas, and hearty dishes prepared from fresh produce, as well as greens grown on-site.

Publico Ristorante stands out as a favourite amongst the Italian restaurants in Singapore for its hearty Italian dishes, including a selection of house-made pasta and wood-fired pizzas beloved by regulars. The latter is especially popular—you have 13 topping combinations to choose from, built atop either a white base or a San Marzano tomato sauce base. The pizza dough is made fresh in-house daily, and fermented for 24 hours before it is rolled out.

Image credit: Publico Ristorante

Another point worth noting: the Roberston Quay restaurant is located by the waterfront, with indoor and outdoor seating options to suit the weather and your mood. Sit indoors for an elevated dining experience, or al fresco to enjoy the view and breeze with a spritz in hand. Out of the lot, their Burrata ($36++) and Prosciutto ($34++) seem to be the top picks among diners!

Website Publico is not a halal-certified eatery.

### 40. Forma

Forma is the brainchild of The Cicheti Group and Ben Fatto 95, the latter the acclaimed private dining chef. This restaurant spotlights pasta dishes that come from lesser-known Italian regions, from Emilia-Romagna to the Amalfi Coast.

The menu at Forma is set up like a traditional Italian trattoria with different sections: Antipasti, AKA, starters, pasta, main courses, and desserts. Come hungry and with a group so you can enjoy multiple dishes and really get a sense of what Forma has to offer. Favourites include the Spaghetti Alla Carbonara ($28++) and Linguine Alle Vongole ($32++): the former is dressed with shavings of guanciale, while the latter is paired with fresh clams.

Cicheti pays homage to Venetian wine bars that serve up small plates bearing a distinct Mediterranean influence. The two-storey trattoria offers a fuss-free menu of small plates, pastas, and wood-fired Neopolitan pizzas. Start off the meal with their small antipasti bites, which include Calamari ($21++) and the Polpo ($29.50++), where octopus is served with a harissa and an arugula salad.

They’ve got two outlets: one along Club Street, which is the OG, and one in Holland Village.

The menu is split into small and big plates, with some perennial classics. The Beef Tongue And Gribiche Sandwich ($28++) is a definite must-order here. The sandwich comprises a stack of house-cured beef tongue, sliced paper-thin, nestled between two slices of shokupan dressed with rich French mayonnaise.

Your regular yum cha and Cantonese restaurant fare gets a serious facelift here, with flavours that, nevertheless, remain true to their roots.

Image credit: Mott32

It’s the kind of restaurant that works best when dining with a group, for you’ll definitely need help when feasting on their famous Apple Wood Roasted 42 Days Peking Duck ($128++), which requires an advanced order. Their fancy dim sum bites are also a must—think xiao long bao prepared with Iberico pork or South Australian scallops, and siew mai dressed up with truffle. Note that they also have plant-based options.

Website Mott32 is not a halal-certified eatery.

### 44. The Masses

The Masses is a popular French-Asian restaurant located at the Capitol, just within a spitting distance from City Hall MRT Station. Their fare seamlessly weaves in Asian and French flavours, so if you have yet to dip your toes into French cuisine, this is an excellent place to start!

If you thought a cabbage dish couldn’t be that interesting, here to prove you wrong is the Purple Cabbage ($19.90++). The vegetable is dressed in ikura, pickled fennel, fresh Hokkaido scallops, and sits in a dashi broth that certainly elevates the dish to new heights.

We would also recommend the simple but delicious Duck Confit ($21.90++), which stars wok hei-infused kway teow, vegetables, and the star of the show: a tender, confit duck leg. If you’re still unsure of what to go for, they have a Communal Menu ($59.90++ per person), which has 10 courses featuring their signature dishes.

Check out our The Masses review.

If you’re craving pizza and pasta, you want to go to Amò. The Clarke Quay restaurant, run by chef-restauranteur Beppe de Vito, has a staggering menu made up of regional Italian fare, including wood-fired pizzas and house-made pasta dishes. The pizzas here are some of the best around, as they’re made with natural leaven, semolina, and extra-virgin olive oil, as well as the restaurant’s very own starter, which makes the dough delightfully pillowy.

Image credit: Amò

The Calabrese ($33++) is a favourite among patrons—the perfect combo of spicy, sweet, and salty. Else, the Meat Lover’s Pizza ($35++) is another: the meaty medley is loaded with minced beef, topped with smoked buffalo mozzarella, caramelised onions, and a drizzle of piquant chilli oil.

Website Amò is not a halal-certified eatery.

### 47. Um Yong Baek

The buzz around Um Yong Baek is well-deserved, and it only takes a visit to figure that out for yourself. The charming Korean restaurant specialises in two variations of Busan pork. At lunch, they offer the Busanese pork stew known as Dwaeji Gukbap ($21+), which features a collagen-rich broth, short-grain rice, and a medley of pork cuts, along with offal.

Come dinner, Um Yong Baek takes a different approach by focusing on pork-centric K-BBQ. They serve premium pork cuts accompanied by a range of unique Busan-inspired sides. Note that each diner is required to order a pork item from their dinner barbecue menu.

### 49. GU:UM

A cool contemporary Korean restaurant you can check out this weekend is GU:UM, a popular spot helmed by the owner of a Michelin-starred restaurant. Here, you can try traditional Korean food with a unique twist, and I can guarantee their menu is one you’ve never seen elsewhere before.

To start, I recommend getting their Yukhwae Jeon ($32++), a crispy potato pancake topped with delicious beef tartare, pickled onions, and egg yolk jam. You can then move on to try the incredibly tasty meat platter: Tajima Wagyu Ribeye MBS 8 ($188++ for 280g) and Iberico Pluma ($118++ for 300g). Though steep in prices, these platters are great for sharing in a group of four or five, making every dollar worth. Finally, end your meal on a sweet note with their gorgeous Hotteok ($18++), a pan-fried rice flour pancake packed with cinnamon and brown sugar, then topped with burnt honey ice cream and mixed nuts.

The Ann Siang institution focuses on small plates, all with Mediterranean DNA, prepared by Chef Joanne Siy, who has worked at some of the world’s most renowned restaurants: think Noma, Fäviken, and the like. Watch the chefs work when you dine from the bar seats, or sit in the communal dining room if you prefer to be removed from the action.

The menu here is seasonal, but we guarantee all the dishes don’t take themselves too seriously. The dining experience remains hearty and fun, with dishes designed to be shared with friends, from hand-torn pasta to tuna belly carpaccio, and their famed sea urchin pudding.
